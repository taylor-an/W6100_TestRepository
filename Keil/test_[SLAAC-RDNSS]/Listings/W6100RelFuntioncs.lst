N  * @version V1.0.0
N  * @date    30-September-2011
N  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M4 Device Peripheral Access Layer Header File. 
N  *          This file contains all the peripheral register's definitions, bits 
N  *          definitions and memory mapping for STM32F4xx devices.
N  *            
N  *          The file is the unique include file that the application programmer
N  *          is using in the C source code, usually in main.c. This file contains:
N  *           - Configuration section that allows to select:
N  *              - The device used in the target application
N  *              - To use or not the peripherals drivers in application code(i.e. 
N  *                code will be based on direct access to peripherals registers 
N  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
N  *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
N  *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE 
N  *                crystal frequency
N  *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
N  *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
N  *           - Macros to access peripherals registers hardware

N  *              - To use or not the peripherals drivers in application code(i.e. 
N  *                code will be based on direct access to peripherals registers 
N  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
N  *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
N  *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE 
N  *                crystal frequency
N  *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
N  *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
